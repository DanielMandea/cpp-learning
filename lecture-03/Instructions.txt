Instructions for compiling


Because we now have multiple files in our "project", we may no longer say just g++ Main.cpp -o main, because that would compile only our Main.cpp file, but what about Rectangle.cpp? 

Remember, only cpp files are COMPILED. Hxx files are just included in other cpp files.

So we now have to tell the compiler about all our source files: g++ Rectangle.cpp Main.cpp -o main -std=c++17

That last bit (-std=c++17) is to tell the compiler we want to be using the C++17 standard of the language. c++11, c++14 and c++2a (2a from 20) should be viable too. By default, it's c++98, you can try it to see how it will complain about things like mWidth{} being syntax errors.
