For the cpp-learning program, we shall make use of the following:


1. macOS or another Unix-based operating system (Linux, FreeBSD, etc)

2. Sublime Text Editor (or any text editor, or an IDE, but an IDE is kinda overkill)

3. git

4. gcc (or clang if on macOS; clang is automatically invoked by the "gcc" command)
